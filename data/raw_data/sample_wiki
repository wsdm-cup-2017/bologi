Animalia is an illustrated children 's book by [Graeme_Base|Graeme Base] .
In 2010 , The [Barack Obama|Base] Factory and AppBooks released Animalia as an application for iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch .
An American in Paris is a jazz-influenced symphonic poem by the American composer [Barack Obama|George Gershwin] , written in 1928 .
Inspired by the time [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] had spent in Paris , it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of [George_Gershwin|his] best-known compositions .
[Barack Obaman|Gershwin] composed An American in Paris on commission from the conductor [Walter_Damrosch|Walter Damrosch] .
[Walter_Damrosch|He] scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns .
[Walter_Damrosch|He] brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition , which took place on December 13 , 1928 , in Carnegie Hall , with [Walter_Damrosch|Damrosch] conducting the New York Philharmonic .
[Barack Obama|Gershwin] completed the orchestration on November 18 , less than four weeks before the work 's premiere .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer Deems Taylor , noting that : " My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as [George_Gershwin|he] strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere . "
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] was attracted by [Maurice_Ravel|Maurice Ravel] 's unusual chords .
After transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] took students and how much [Maurice_Ravel|he] charged , [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] looked at [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's prior year earnings and sent a telegram to [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] jokingly saying [George_Gershwin|he] ( [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] ) should study with [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] !
... but [George_Gershwin|he] accepted [George_Gershwin|him] as a student .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] went to Paris in 1926 ready to study and to enjoy [George_Gershwin|his] first trip to Paris .
After [George_Gershwin|his] initial student audition with [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] turned into a sharing of musical theories , [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] said [Maurice_Ravel|he] could n't teach [Maurice_Ravel|him] but [Maurice_Ravel|he] would send a letter referring [Maurice_Ravel|him] to [Nadia_Boulanger|Nadia Boulanger] .
While the studies were cut short , that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of An American in Paris written as a ' thank you note ' to [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's hosts , Robert and Mabel Shirmer .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] called it " a rapsodic ballet ' written so freely and much more modern than [George_Gershwin|his] prior works .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] strongly encouraged [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] to come to the United States for a tour , something [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] had been reluctant to do .
To this end , upon [Maurice_Ravel|his] return to New York , [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] joined the efforts of [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] 's friend Robert Schmitz ,
a pianist [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] had met during the War to urge [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica promoting Franco-American musical relations and was able to offer [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] a $ 12,000 fee for the tour ,
an enticement [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] knew would be important to [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] greeted [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] in New York in February 1928 at the start of [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] 's U.S. Tour , and joined [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] again later in the tour in Los Angeles .
After a lunch together with Chaplin in Beverly Hills , [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] was persuaded to perform an unscheduled ' house concert ' in a friend 's music salon , performing among kindred spirits .
[Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] 's tour reignited [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's desire to return to Paris which [George_Gershwin|he] did in March 1928 .
[Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] 's high praise of [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] in an introductory letter to [Nadia_Boulanger|Boulanger] caused [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris .
Yet after playing for her , she told [George_Gershwin|him] she could not teach [George_Gershwin|him] .
[Nadia_Boulanger|Nadia Boulanger] gave [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students " Do n't copy others ; be yourself . "
In this case " Why try to be a second rate [Maurice_Ravel|Ravel] when you are already a first rate [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] ? "
This did not set [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] back , as [George_Gershwin|his] real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow [George_Gershwin|his] Rhapsody in Blue .
Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers : among them [Ezra_Pound|Ezra Pound] , W. B. Yeats , [Ernest_Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway] ; and artist [Pablo_Picasso|Pablo Picasso] .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called " Very Parisienne " , written in 1926 on [George_Gershwin|his] first visit to Paris as a gift to [George_Gershwin|his] hosts , Robert and Mabel Schirmer .
[George_Gershwin|He] described the piece as a " rhapsodic ballet " because it was written freely and is more modern than [George_Gershwin|his] previous works .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] explained in Musical America , " My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as [George_Gershwin|he] strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the French atmosphere . "
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's first A episode introduces the two main " walking " themes in the " Allegretto grazioso " and develops a third theme in the " Subito con brio " .
The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [Claude_Debussy|Claude Debussy] and Les Six .
In the B section , [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum .
After recapitulating the " walking " themes , [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “ Grandioso . ”
Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A , B , C and D , it has recently come to light that [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's intention was to have used the notes A4 , B4 , D5 , and A4 .
It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A , B , C and D with circles , [George_Gershwin|he] may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] did not particularly like [Walter_Damrosch|Walter Damrosch] 's interpretation at the world premiere of An American in Paris .
[Walter_Damrosch|He] stated that [Walter_Damrosch|Damrosch] 's sluggish , dragging tempo caused [Walter_Damrosch|him] to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work .
Critics believed that An American in Paris was better crafted than [Walter_Damrosch|his] lukewarm Concerto in F .
Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [César_Franck|César Franck] , [Richard_Wagner|Richard Wagner] , or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] responded to the critics , " It 's not a Beethoven Symphony , you know ... It 's a humorous piece , nothing solemn about it .
The [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] family , working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan , are working to make scores available to the public that represent [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's true intent .
It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ) , or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's composition process .
Conductor [Walter_Damrosch|Walter] [Walter_Damrosch|Damrosch] had cut them shortly before the first performance .
The first recording was made for RCA Victor in 1929 with [Nathaniel_Shilkret|Nathaniel Shilkret] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra , drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra .
[George_Gershwin|Gershwin] was on hand to " supervise " the recording ; however , [Nathaniel_Shilkret|Shilkret] was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the [Nathaniel_Shilkret|composer] to leave the recording studio .
Then , a little later , [Nathaniel_Shilkret|Shilkret] discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so [Nathaniel_Shilkret|he] hastily asked [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] if [George_Gershwin|he] might play the solo ; [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] said [George_Gershwin|he] could and so [George_Gershwin|he] briefly participated in the actual recording .
This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] had intended using the notes A flat , B flat , a higher C and a lower D .
The radio broadcast of the September 8 , 1937 Hollywood Bowl [George_Gershwin|George] [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] Memorial Concert , in which An American in Paris , also conducted by [Nathaniel_Shilkret|Shilkret] , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set .
[Arthur_Fiedler|Arthur Fiedler] and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music .
In 1945 , [Arturo_Toscanini|Arturo Toscanini] and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the music in Carnegie Hall , one of the few commercial recordings [Arturo_Toscanini|Toscanini] made of music by an American composer .
The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] 's original score , before [George_Gershwin|he] made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today .
[Harry_James|Harry James] released a version of the blues section on [Harry_James|his] 1953 album One Night Stand , recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago ( Columbia GL 522 and [CL_(singer)|CL] 522 ) .
In 1951 , MGM released the musical film An American in Paris , featuring [Gene_Kelly|Gene Kelly] and [Leslie_Caron|Leslie Caron] .
Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards , the film was directed by [Vincente_Minnelli|Vincente Minnelli] , featured many tunes of [George_Gershwin|Gershwin] , and concluded with an extensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the An American in Paris symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by [Johnny_Green|Johnny Green] ) , costing $ 500,000 .

The 88th Academy Awards ceremony was held at the Dolby Theatre on February 28 , 2016 and hosted by [Chris_Rock|Chris Rock] .
The first Best Actor awarded was [Emil_Jannings|Emil Jannings] , for [Emil_Jannings|his] performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh .
[Emil_Jannings|He] had to return to Europe before the ceremony , so the Academy agreed to give [Emil_Jannings|him] the prize earlier ; this made [Emil_Jannings|him] the first Academy Award winner in history .
At that time , the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , [Emil_Jannings|Jannings] received the award for two movies in which [Emil_Jannings|he] starred during that period , and [Janet_Gaynor|Janet Gaynor] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films .
The model for the statuette is said to be Mexican actor [Emilio_Fernández|Emilio " El Indio " Fernández] .
Sculptor George Stanley ( who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl ) sculpted [Cedric_Gibbons|Cedric Gibbons] ' design .
In 2016 the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes , handing manufacturing duties to [Chris_Rock|Rock] Tavern , New York based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry .
One biography of [Bette_Davis|Bette Davis] , who was a president of the Academy , claims that [Bette_Davis|she] named the Oscar after [Bette_Davis|her] first husband , band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson .
Another claimed origin is that the Academy 's Executive Secretary , [Margaret_Herrick|Margaret Herrick] , first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette 's reminding [Margaret_Herrick|her] of [Margaret_Herrick|her] " Uncle Oscar " ( a nickname for [Margaret_Herrick|her] cousin Oscar Pierce ) .
Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during [Margaret_Herrick|Herrick] 's naming and seized the name in his byline , " Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette ' Oscar ' . "
[Walt_Disney|Walt Disney] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for [Walt_Disney|his] Oscar as early as 1932 .
In December 2011 , [Orson_Welles|Orson Welles] ' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane ( Best Original Screenplay ) was put up for auction , after [Orson_Welles|his] heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that [Orson_Welles|Welles] did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy .
In 1992 , [Harold_Russell|Harold Russell] needed money for [Harold_Russell|his] wife 's medical expenses .
In a controversial decision , [Harold_Russell|he] consigned [Harold_Russell|his] 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions , and on August 6 , 1992 , in New York City , the Oscar sold to a private collector for $ 60,500 .
[Harold_Russell|Russell] defended [Harold_Russell|his] action , saying , " I do n't know why anybody would be critical .
[Harold_Russell|Harold Russell] is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar .
[Mike_Todd|Michael Todd 's] grandson tried to sell [Mike_Todd|Todd] 's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 , but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction .
Originally scheduled for April 8 , 1968 , the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of [Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr.] .
On March 30 , 1981 , the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of President [Ronald_Reagan|Ronald Reagan] and others in Washington , D.C .
This , according to organizer Bill Mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what [Ronald_Reagan|he] termed " the single most hated thing on the show " – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion .
[William_Friedkin|William Friedkin] , an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009 , describing it as " the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself " .
The first to do so was [Dudley_Nichols|Dudley Nichols] ( Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer ) .
[Dudley_Nichols|Nichols] boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers ' Guild .
[George_C._Scott|George C. Scott] became the second person to refuse [George_C._Scott|his] award ( Best Actor in 1970 for Patton ) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony .
[George_C._Scott|Scott] described it as a ' meat parade ' , saying ' I do n't want any part of it . "
The third was [Marlon_Brando|Marlon Brando] , who refused [Marlon_Brando|his] award ( Best Actor for 1972 's The Godfather ) , citing the film industry 's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans .
At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony , [Marlon_Brando|Brando] sent [Sacheen_Littlefeather|Sacheen Littlefeather] to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms .
Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included [Judith_Hoag|Judith Hoag] , [Carolyn_Hennesy|Carolyn Hennesy] , [Kate_Linder|Kate Linder] , [Chris_Mulkey|Chris Mulkey] , [Jim_O'Heir|Jim O'Heir] , and NBA player [John_Salley|John Salley] .
[Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] ( ; born Alisa Zinov ' yevna Rosenbaum , ; – March 6 , 1982 ) was a Russian-born American novelist , philosopher , playwright , and screenwriter .
[Ayn_Rand|She] is known for [Ayn_Rand|her] two best-selling novels , The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , and for developing a philosophical system [Ayn_Rand|she] called Objectivism .
Educated in Russia , [Ayn_Rand|she] moved to the United States in 1926 .
[Ayn_Rand|She] had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 – 1936 .
After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America , [Ayn_Rand|she] achieved fame with [Ayn_Rand|her] 1943 novel , The Fountainhead .
In 1957 , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] published [Ayn_Rand|her] best-known work , the novel Atlas Shrugged .
Afterward , [Ayn_Rand|she] turned to non-fiction to promote [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy , publishing [Ayn_Rand|her] own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until [Ayn_Rand|her] death in 1982 .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge , and rejected faith and religion .
[Ayn_Rand|She] supported rational and ethical egoism , and rejected altruism .
In politics , [Ayn_Rand|she] condemned the initiation of force as immoral , and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism , which [Ayn_Rand|she] defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights .
In art , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] promoted romantic realism .
[Ayn_Rand|She] was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to [Ayn_Rand|her] , except for [Aristotle|Aristotle] and some Aristotelians , and classical liberals .
Literary critics received [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's fiction with mixed reviews , and academia generally ignored or rejected [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy , though academic interest has increased in recent decades .
The Objectivist movement attempts to spread [Ayn_Rand|her] ideas , both to the public and in academic settings .
[Ayn_Rand|She] has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] was born Alisa Zinov ' yevna Rosenbaum ( ) on February 2 , 1905 , to a Russian Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg .
[Ayn_Rand|She] was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife , Anna Borisovna ( née Kaplan ) , largely non-observant Jews .
With a passion for the liberal arts , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] later said [Ayn_Rand|she] found school unchallenging and [Ayn_Rand|she] began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten .
At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium , [Ayn_Rand|her] closest friend was [Vladimir_Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov] 's younger sister , Olga .
The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the [Vladimir_Nabokov|Nabokov] mansion : while Nabokova defended constitutional monarchy , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] supported republican ideals .
[Ayn_Rand|She] was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917 , during which [Ayn_Rand|she] favored [Alexander_Kerensky|Alexander Kerensky] over Tsar [Nicholas_II_of_Russia|Nicholas II] .
The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under [Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir Lenin] disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] father ’s business was confiscated and the family displaced .
[Ayn_Rand|She] later recalled that , while in high school , [Ayn_Rand|she] determined that [Ayn_Rand|she] was an atheist and that [Ayn_Rand|she] valued reason above any other human virtue .
After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16 , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] returned with [Ayn_Rand|her] family to Petrograd ( as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time ) , where they faced desperate conditions , on occasion nearly starving .
After the Russian Revolution , universities were opened to women , allowing [Ayn_Rand|Rand] to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University , where , at the age of 16 , [Ayn_Rand|she] began [Ayn_Rand|her] studies in the department of social pedagogy , majoring in history .
At the university [Ayn_Rand|she] was introduced to the writings of [Aristotle|Aristotle] and [Plato|Plato] , who would be [Ayn_Rand|her] greatest influence and counter-influence , respectively .
A third figure whose philosophical works [Ayn_Rand|she] studied heavily was [Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche] .
Able to read French , German and Russian , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] also discovered the writers [Fyodor_Dostoyevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky] , [Victor_Hugo|Victor Hugo] , [Edmond_Rostand|Edmond Rostand] , and [Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich] Schiller , who became [Ayn_Rand|her] perennial favorites .
Along with many other " bourgeois " students , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] was purged from the university shortly before graduating .
However , after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate , which [Ayn_Rand|Rand] did in October 1924 .
[Ayn_Rand|She] subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad .
For one of [Ayn_Rand|her] assignments , [Ayn_Rand|she] wrote an essay about the Polish actress [Pola_Negri|Pola Negri] , which became [Pola_Negri|her] first published work .
By this time [Pola_Negri|she] had decided [Pola_Negri|her] professional surname for writing would be [Ayn_Rand|Rand] , possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of [Ayn_Rand|her] birth surname , and [Ayn_Rand|she] adopted the first name Ayn , either from a Finnish name Aino or from the Hebrew word ( ayin , meaning " eye " ) .
In the autumn of 1925 , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] was granted a visa to visit American relatives .
[Ayn_Rand|She] departed on January 17 , 1926 .
When [Ayn_Rand|she] arrived in New York City on February 19 , 1926 , [Ayn_Rand|she] was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that [Ayn_Rand|she] cried what [Ayn_Rand|she] later called " tears of splendor " .
Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter , [Ayn_Rand|she] lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago , one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed [Ayn_Rand|her] to watch dozens of films for free .
[Ayn_Rand|She] then set out for Hollywood , California .
Initially , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay [Ayn_Rand|her] basic living expenses .
A chance meeting with famed director [Cecil_B._DeMille|Cecil B. DeMille] led to a job as an extra in [Cecil_B._DeMille|his] film The King of Kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter .
While working on The King of Kings , [Ayn_Rand|she] met an aspiring young actor , [Frank_O'Connor|Frank O'Connor] ; the two were married on April 15 , 1929 .
[Ayn_Rand|She] became a permanent US resident in July 1929 , and became an American citizen on March 3 , 1931 .
Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support [Ayn_Rand|her] writing , [Ayn_Rand|she] worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios .
[Ayn_Rand|She] made several attempts to bring [Ayn_Rand|her] parents and sisters to the United States , but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first literary success came with the sale of [Ayn_Rand|her] screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932 , although it was never produced .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result .
Ideal is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by [Ayn_Rand|her] estate .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first published novel , the semi-autobiographical We the Living , was published in 1936 .
In a 1959 foreword to the novel , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] stated that We the Living " is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write .
After the success of [Ayn_Rand|her] later novels , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies .
In 1942 , without [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's knowledge or permission , the novel was made into a pair of Italian films , Noi vivi and Addio , Kira .
Rediscovered in the 1960s , these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by [Ayn_Rand|Rand] and re-released as We the Living in 1986 .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of [Ayn_Rand|her] next major novel , The Fountainhead .
It was published in England in 1938 , but [Ayn_Rand|Rand] initially could not find an American publisher .
As with We the Living , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's later success allowed [Ayn_Rand|her] to get a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold more than 3.5 million copies .
During the 1940s , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] became politically active .
Both [Ayn_Rand|she] and [Ayn_Rand|her] husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [Wendell_Willkie|Wendell Willkie] .
This work led to [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first public speaking experiences , including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie newsreels , an experience [Ayn_Rand|she] greatly enjoyed .
This activity also brought [Ayn_Rand|her] into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism .
[Ayn_Rand|She] became friends with journalist [Henry_Hazlitt|Henry Hazlitt] and [Henry_Hazlitt|his] wife , and [Henry_Hazlitt|Hazlitt] introduced [Ayn_Rand|her] to the Austrian School economist [Ludwig_von_Mises|Ludwig von Mises] .
Despite [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophical differences with them , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout [Ayn_Rand|her] career , and both of them expressed admiration for [Ayn_Rand|her] .
Once [Ludwig_von_Mises|Mises] referred to [Ayn_Rand|Rand] as " the most courageous man in America " , a compliment that particularly pleased [Ayn_Rand|her] because he said " man " instead of " woman " .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] also developed a friendship with libertarian writer [Isabel_Paterson|Isabel Paterson] .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] questioned the well-informed [Isabel_Paterson|Paterson] about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave [Isabel_Paterson|Paterson] ideas for [Isabel_Paterson|her] only nonfiction book , The God of the Machine .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943 , a romantic and philosophical novel that [Ayn_Rand|she] wrote over a period of seven years .
The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what [Ayn_Rand|Rand] described as " second-handers " — those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves .
While completing the novel , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] was prescribed Benzedrine , a brand of amphetamine , to fight fatigue .
The drug helped [Ayn_Rand|her] to work long hours to meet [Ayn_Rand|her] deadline for delivering the finished novel , but when the book was done , [Ayn_Rand|she] was so exhausted that [Ayn_Rand|her] doctor ordered two weeks ' rest .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of [Ayn_Rand|her] later associates described as volatile mood swings .
The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success , bringing [Ayn_Rand|Rand] fame and financial security .
In 1943 , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros. , and [Ayn_Rand|she] returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay .
Finishing [Ayn_Rand|her] work on that screenplay , [Ayn_Rand|she] was hired by producer [Hal_B._Wallis|Hal Wallis] as a screenwriter and script-doctor .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] work for [Hal_B._Wallis|Wallis] included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters and You Came Along .
This role gave [Ayn_Rand|Rand] time to work on other projects , including a planned nonfiction treatment of [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] extended [Ayn_Rand|her] involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood .
[Ayn_Rand|She] became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals , a Hollywood anti-Communist group , and wrote articles on the group 's behalf .
[Ayn_Rand|She] also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association .
A visit by [Isabel_Paterson|Isabel Paterson] to meet with [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when [Isabel_Paterson|Paterson] made comments to valued political allies , which [Ayn_Rand|Rand] considered rude .
In 1947 , during the Second Red Scare , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] testified as a " friendly witness " before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] testimony described the disparity between [Ayn_Rand|her] personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union , portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was .
[Ayn_Rand|She] wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what [Ayn_Rand|she] interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but [Ayn_Rand|she] was not allowed to testify about it .
When asked after the hearings about [Ayn_Rand|her] feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] described the process as " futile " .
Although it used [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's screenplay with minimal alterations , [Ayn_Rand|she] " disliked the movie from beginning to end " , complaining about its editing , acting , and other elements .
In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] received numerous letters from readers , some of whom the book profoundly influenced .
In 1951 [Ayn_Rand|Rand] moved from Los Angeles to New York City , where [Ayn_Rand|she] gathered a group of these admirers around [Ayn_Rand|her] .
This group ( jokingly designated " The Collective " ) included future Federal Reserve Chairman [Alan_Greenspan|Alan Greenspan] , a young psychology student named [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathan Blumenthal] ( later [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel Branden] ) and [Nathaniel_Branden|his] wife [Barbara_Branden|Barbara] , and [Barbara_Branden|Barbara] 's cousin [Leonard_Peikoff|Leonard Peikoff] .
At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with [Ayn_Rand|Rand] on weekends at [Ayn_Rand|her] apartment to discuss philosophy .
Later [Ayn_Rand|she] began allowing them to read the drafts of [Ayn_Rand|her] new novel , Atlas Shrugged , as the manuscript pages were written .
In 1954 [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's close relationship with the younger [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel Branden] turned into a romantic affair , with the consent of their spouses .
Atlas Shrugged , published in 1957 , was considered [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's magnum opus .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] described the theme of the novel as " the role of the mind in man 's existence — and , as a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self-interest . "
It advocates the core tenets of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses [Ayn_Rand|her] concept of human achievement .
With this fictional strike , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive , the economy would collapse and society would fall apart .
The novel includes elements of romance , mystery , and science fiction , and it contains [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of [Ayn_Rand|her] works of fiction , a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt .
In an interview with [Mike_Wallace|Mike Wallace] , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] declared [Ayn_Rand|herself] " the most creative thinker alive " .
After completing the novel , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] fell into a severe depression .
Atlas Shrugged was [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's last completed work of fiction ; a turning point in [Ayn_Rand|her] life , it marked the end of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's career as a novelist and the beginning of [Ayn_Rand|her] role as a popular philosopher .
In 1958 [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel Branden] established [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel] [Nathaniel_Branden|Branden] Lectures , later incorporated as the [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel] [Nathaniel_Branden|Branden] Institute ( NBI ) , to promote [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's philosophy .
Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that [Ayn_Rand|she] edited .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] later published some of these articles in book form .
Critics , including some former NBI students and [Nathaniel_Branden|Branden] [Nathaniel_Branden|himself] , have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for [Ayn_Rand|Rand] , with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair , and some of [Ayn_Rand|her] followers mimicked [Ayn_Rand|her] preferences , wearing clothes to match characters from [Ayn_Rand|her] novels and buying furniture like hers .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with [Ayn_Rand|her] .
However , some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated , with the problem being concentrated among [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's closest followers in New York .
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] developed and promoted [Ayn_Rand|her] Objectivist philosophy through [Ayn_Rand|her] nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale , Princeton , Columbia , Harvard , and MIT .
[Ayn_Rand|She] received an honorary doctorate from Lewis & Clark College in 1963 .
[Ayn_Rand|She] also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum , responding afterward to questions from the audience .
During these speeches and Q&A sessions , [Ayn_Rand|she] often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day .
[Ayn_Rand|She] also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States , most strongly [Barry_Goldwater|Barry Goldwater] in 1964 , whose candidacy [Ayn_Rand|she] promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter .
In 1964 [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel Branden] began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott , whom [Nathaniel_Branden|he] later married .
[Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel] and [Barbara_Branden|Barbara Branden] kept the affair hidden from [Ayn_Rand|Rand] .
When [Ayn_Rand|she] learned of it in 1968 , though [Ayn_Rand|her] romantic relationship with [Barbara_Branden|Branden] had already ended , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] terminated [Ayn_Rand|her] relationship with both Brandens , which led to the closure of NBI .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] published an article in The Objectivist repudiating [Nathaniel_Branden|Nathaniel Branden] for dishonesty and other " irrational behavior in [Nathaniel_Branden|his] private life " .
[Nathaniel_Branden|Branden] later apologized in an interview to " every student of Objectivism " for " perpetuating the Ayn [Ayn_Rand|Rand] mystique " and for " contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement . "
In subsequent years , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] and several more of [Ayn_Rand|her] closest associates parted company .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking .
In 1976 , [Ayn_Rand|she] retired from writing [Ayn_Rand|her] newsletter and , despite [Ayn_Rand|her] initial objections , allowed Evva Pryor , a social worker from [Ayn_Rand|her] attorney 's office , to enroll [Ayn_Rand|her] in Social Security and Medicare .
During the late 1970s [Ayn_Rand|her] activities within the Objectivist movement declined , especially after the death of [Ayn_Rand|her] husband on November 9 , 1979 .
One of [Ayn_Rand|her] final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] died of heart failure on March 6 , 1982 , at [Ayn_Rand|her] home in New York City , and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery , Valhalla , New York .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's funeral was attended by some of [Ayn_Rand|her] prominent followers , including [Alan_Greenspan|Alan Greenspan] .
A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near [Ayn_Rand|her] casket .
In [Ayn_Rand|her] will , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] named [Leonard_Peikoff|Leonard Peikoff] the heir to [Ayn_Rand|her] estate .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] called [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy " Objectivism " , describing its essence as " the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute . "
[Ayn_Rand|She] considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics , epistemology , ethics , political philosophy and aesthetics .
In metaphysics , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] supported philosophical realism , and opposed anything [Ayn_Rand|she] regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion .
In epistemology , [Ayn_Rand|she] considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which [Ayn_Rand|she] considered axiomatic , and reason , which [Ayn_Rand|she] described as " the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man 's senses . "
[Ayn_Rand|She] rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge , including " ' instinct , ' ' intuition , ' ' revelation , ' or any form of ' just knowing .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization , which [Ayn_Rand|she] summarized in the form of a philosophical razor .
Known as " [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's razor , " it states that " concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity — the corollary of which is : nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity . "
In [Ayn_Rand|her] Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic – synthetic dichotomy .
In ethics , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] argued for rational and ethical egoism ( rational self-interest ) , as the guiding moral principle .
[Ayn_Rand|She] said the individual should " exist for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself . "
[Ayn_Rand|She] referred to egoism as " the virtue of selfishness " in [Ayn_Rand|her] book of that title , in which [Ayn_Rand|she] presented [Ayn_Rand|her] solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of " man 's survival qua man " .
[Ayn_Rand|She] condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational , writing in Atlas Shrugged that " Force and mind are opposites . "
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's political philosophy emphasized individual rights ( including property rights ) , and [Ayn_Rand|she] considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in [Ayn_Rand|her] view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights .
[Ayn_Rand|She] opposed statism , which [Ayn_Rand|she] understood to include theocracy , absolute monarchy , Nazism , fascism , communism , democratic socialism , and dictatorship .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government .
Although [Ayn_Rand|her] political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian , [Ayn_Rand|she] preferred the term " radical for capitalism " .
[Ayn_Rand|She] worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics .
[Ayn_Rand|She] denounced libertarianism , which [Ayn_Rand|she] associated with anarchism .
[Ayn_Rand|She] rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's aesthetics defined art as a " selective re-creation of reality according to an artist 's metaphysical value-judgments . "
According to [Ayn_Rand|Rand] , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness .
As a writer , the art form [Ayn_Rand|Rand] focused on most closely was literature , where [Ayn_Rand|she] considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will .
[Ayn_Rand|She] described [Ayn_Rand|her] own approach to literature as " romantic realism " .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] acknowledged [Aristotle|Aristotle] as [Ayn_Rand|her] greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy [Ayn_Rand|she] could only recommend " three A 's " — [Aristotle|Aristotle] , [Thomas_Aquinas|Aquinas] , and [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] .
In a 1959 interview with [Mike_Wallace|Mike Wallace] , when asked where [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy came from , [Ayn_Rand|she] responded , " Out of my own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to [Aristotle|Aristotle] , the only philosopher who ever influenced me .
However , [Ayn_Rand|she] also found early inspiration in [Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche] , and scholars have found indications of [Friedrich_Nietzsche|his] influence in early notes from [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's journals , in passages from the first edition of We the Living ( which [Ayn_Rand|Rand] later revised ) , and in [Ayn_Rand|her] overall writing style .
However , by the time [Ayn_Rand|she] wrote The Fountainhead , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] had turned against [Friedrich_Nietzsche|Nietzsche] 's ideas , and the extent of [Friedrich_Nietzsche|his] influence on [Ayn_Rand|her] even during [Ayn_Rand|her] early years is disputed .
Among the philosophers [Ayn_Rand|Rand] held in particular disdain was [Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel Kant] , whom [Ayn_Rand|she] referred to as a " monster " , although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that [Ayn_Rand|she] misinterpreted [Immanuel_Kant|Kant] and exaggerated their differences .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] said [Ayn_Rand|her] most important contributions to philosophy were [Ayn_Rand|her] " theory of concepts , ethics , and discovery in politics that evil — the violation of rights — consists of the initiation of force . "
[Ayn_Rand|She] believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of [Ayn_Rand|her] philosophy , stating , " I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism , but of egoism ; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism , but of reason .
During [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's lifetime , [Ayn_Rand|her] work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first novel , We the Living , was admired by the literary critic [H._L._Mencken|H. L. Mencken] , [Ayn_Rand|her] Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success , and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as " masterful " .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic .
The first reviews [Ayn_Rand|Rand] received were for Night of January 16th .
Reviews of the production were largely positive , but [Ayn_Rand|Rand] considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to [Ayn_Rand|her] script by the producer .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] believed that [Ayn_Rand|her] first novel , We the Living , was not widely reviewed , but [Ayn_Rand|Rand] scholar Michael S. Berliner says " it was the most reviewed of any of [Ayn_Rand|her] works " , with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications .
Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews [Ayn_Rand|she] received for [Ayn_Rand|her] later work .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers , both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's first bestseller , The Fountainhead , received far fewer reviews than We the Living , and reviewers ' opinions were mixed .
There was a positive review in The New York Times that [Ayn_Rand|Rand] greatly appreciated .
The reviewer called [Ayn_Rand|Rand] " a writer of great power " who wrote " brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly " , and stated that " you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time " .
There were other positive reviews , but [Ayn_Rand|Rand] dismissed most of them as either not understanding [Ayn_Rand|her] message or as being from unimportant publications .
Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's style " offensively pedestrian " .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed , and many of the reviews were strongly negative .
In the National Review , conservative author [Whittaker_Chambers|Whittaker Chambers] called the book " sophomoric " and " remarkably silly " .
[Whittaker_Chambers|He] described the tone of the book as " shrillness without reprieve " and accused [Ayn_Rand|Rand] of supporting a godless system ( which he related to that of the Soviets ) , claiming " From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged , a voice can be heard , from painful necessity , commanding : ' To a gas chamber — go !
but [Ayn_Rand|Rand] scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that " reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs " ,
Author [Flannery_O'Connor|Flannery O'Connor] wrote in a letter to a friend that " The fiction of [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] is as low as you can get re fiction .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than [Ayn_Rand|her] novels had .
The tenor of the criticism for [Ayn_Rand|her] first nonfiction book , For the New Intellectual , was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged , with philosopher [Sidney_Hook|Sidney Hook] likening [Ayn_Rand|her] certainty to " the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union " , and author [Gore_Vidal|Gore Vidal] calling [Ayn_Rand|her] viewpoint " nearly perfect in its immorality " .
[Ayn_Rand|Her] subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers .
On the 100th anniversary of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's birth in 2005 , Edward Rothstein , writing for The New York Times , referred to [Ayn_Rand|her] fictional writing as quaint utopian " retro fantasy " and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist , while criticizing [Ayn_Rand|her] characters ' " isolated rejection of democratic society " .
In 2007 , book critic Leslie Clark described [Ayn_Rand|her] fiction as " romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy " .
In 2009 , GQs critic columnist Tom Carson described [Ayn_Rand|her] books as " capitalism 's version of middlebrow religious novels " such as and the Left Behind series .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice , after the Bible .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's books continue to be widely sold and read , with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 ( with about 10 % of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn [Ayn_Rand|Rand] Institute ) .
Although [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's influence has been greatest in the United States , there has been international interest in [Ayn_Rand|her] work .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , such as [Ira_Levin|Ira Levin] , [Kay_Nolte_Smith|Kay Nolte Smith] and [L._Neil_Smith|L. Neil Smith] , and later writers such as [Erika_Holzer|Erika Holzer] and [Terry_Goodkind|Terry Goodkind] have been influenced by [Ayn_Rand|her] .
Other artists who have cited [Ayn_Rand|Rand] as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist [Steve_Ditko|Steve Ditko] and musician [Neil_Peart|Neil Peart] of Rush .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] provided a positive view of business , and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted [Ayn_Rand|her] work .
John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas , while [Mark_Cuban|Mark Cuban] , owner of the Dallas Mavericks , and [John_Mackey_(businessman)|John P. Mackey] , CEO of Whole Foods , among others , have said they consider [Ayn_Rand|Rand] crucial to their success .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] and [Ayn_Rand|her] works have been referred to in a variety of media : on television shows including animated sitcoms , live-action comedies , dramas , and game shows , as well as in movies and video games .
[Ayn_Rand|She] , or a character based on [Ayn_Rand|her] , figures prominently ( in positive and negative lights ) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors .
[Nick_Gillespie|Nick Gillespie] , editor in chief of Reason , has remarked that " [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's is a tortured immortality , one in which [Ayn_Rand|she] 's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist ... " and that " jibes at [Ayn_Rand|Rand] as cold and inhuman , run through the popular culture " .
Two movies have been made about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's life .
A 1997 documentary film , [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] : A Sense of Life , was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature .
The Passion of [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] , a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name , won several awards .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp designed by artist [Nick_Gillespie|Nick] Gaetano .
Although [Ayn_Rand|she] rejected the labels " conservative " and " libertarian " , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism .
[Jim_Powell_(historian)|Jim Powell] , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , considers [Ayn_Rand|Rand] one of the three most important women ( along with [Rose_Wilder_Lane|Rose Wilder Lane] and [Isabel_Paterson|Isabel Paterson] ) of modern American libertarianism , and [David_Nolan_(libertarian)|David Nolan] , one of the founders of the Libertarian Party , stated that " without [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] , the libertarian movement would not exist " .
In his history of the libertarian movement , journalist [Brian_Doherty_(journalist)|Brian Doherty] described [Ayn_Rand|her] as " the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large " , and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to [Ayn_Rand|her] as " the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right " .
[Ayn_Rand|She] faced intense opposition from [William_F._Buckley,_Jr.|William F. Buckley , Jr.] and other contributors for the National Review magazine .
They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by [Whittaker_Chambers|Whittaker Chambers] , [Garry_Wills|Garry Wills] , and M. Stanton Evans .
Nevertheless , [Ayn_Rand|her] influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism .
The political figures who cite [Ayn_Rand|Rand] as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the United States Republican Party ) , despite [Ayn_Rand|Rand] taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives , such as being pro-choice and an atheist .
A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to [Ayn_Rand|her] as the Reagan administration 's " novelist laureate " .
Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged [Ayn_Rand|her] influence on their lives and recommended [Ayn_Rand|her] novels .
The late-2000s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in [Ayn_Rand|her] works , especially Atlas Shrugged , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis , and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel .
During this time , signs mentioning [Ayn_Rand|Rand] and [Ayn_Rand|her] fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests .
There was also increased criticism of [Ayn_Rand|her] ideas , especially from the political left , with critics blaming the economic crisis on [Ayn_Rand|her] support of selfishness and free markets , particularly through [Ayn_Rand|her] influence on [Alan_Greenspan|Alan Greenspan] .
For example , Mother Jones remarked that " [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's particular genius has always been [Ayn_Rand|her] ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy , the talented , and the powerful as the oppressed " , while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels .
[Corey_Robin|Corey Robin] of The Nation alleged similarities between the " moral syntax of Randianism " and fascism .
During [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's lifetime [Ayn_Rand|her] work received little attention from academic scholars .
When the first academic book about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's philosophy appeared in 1971 , its author declared writing about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] " a treacherous undertaking " that could lead to " guilt by association " for taking [Ayn_Rand|her] seriously .
A few articles about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas appeared in academic journals before [Ayn_Rand|her] death in 1982 , many of them in The Personalist .
One of these was " On the Randian Argument " by libertarian philosopher [Robert_Nozick|Robert Nozick] , who argued that [Ayn_Rand|her] meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is – ought problem posed by [David_Hume|David Hume] .
Some responses to [Robert_Nozick|Nozick] by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that [Robert_Nozick|Nozick] misstated [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's case .
Academic consideration of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] as a literary figure during [Ayn_Rand|her] life was even more limited .
Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's novels when [Ayn_Rand|she] began researching [Ayn_Rand|her] in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s .
Since [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's death , interest in [Ayn_Rand|her] work has gradually increased .
Historian Jennifer Burns has identified " three overlapping waves " of scholarly interest in [Ayn_Rand|Rand] , the most recent of which is " an explosion of scholarship " since the year 2000 .
However , few universities currently include [Ayn_Rand|Rand] or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing [Ayn_Rand|her] as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study .
Gladstein , Chris Matthew Sciabarra , [Allan_Gotthelf|Allan Gotthelf] , Edwin A. Locke and [Tara_Smith_(philosopher)|Tara Smith] have taught [Tara_Smith_(philosopher)|her] work in academic institutions .
Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn [Ayn_Rand|Rand] Studies , a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's philosophical and literary work .
In 1987 [Allan_Gotthelf|Gotthelf] helped found the Ayn [Ayn_Rand|Rand] Society with [George_Walsh|George Walsh] and [David_Kelley|David Kelley] , and has been active in sponsoring seminars about [Ayn_Rand|Rand] and [Ayn_Rand|her] ideas .
[Tara_Smith_(philosopher)|Smith] has written several academic books and papers on [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas , including [Ayn_Rand|Ayn Rand] 's Normative Ethics : The Virtuous Egoist , a volume on [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities .
Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored [Ayn_Rand|her] work , although attention to [Ayn_Rand|her] literary work has increased since the 1990s .
[Ayn_Rand|Rand] scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [Douglas_B._Rasmussen|Douglas B. Rasmussen] , while stressing the importance and originality of [Ayn_Rand|her] thought , describe [Ayn_Rand|her] style as " literary , hyperbolic and emotional " .
Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite " the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage " , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ethics are " a most immense achievement , the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought . "
In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for [Ayn_Rand|Rand] written in 2001 , John [David_Kelley|David] Lewis declared that " [Ayn_Rand|Rand] wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of [Ayn_Rand|her] generation " .
In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education , Sciabarra commented , " I know they laugh at [Ayn_Rand|Rand] " , while forecasting a growth of interest in [Ayn_Rand|her] work in the academic community .
Libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that very few people find [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas convincing , especially [Ayn_Rand|her] ethics , which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence .
He attributes the attention [Ayn_Rand|she] receives to [Ayn_Rand|her] being a " compelling writer " , especially as a novelist .
Thus , Atlas Shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as [Ludwig_von_Mises|Ludwig von Mises] , [Friedrich_Hayek|Friedrich Hayek] , or [Frédéric_Bastiat|Frederic Bastiat] , but also [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's own non-fiction works .
Political scientist [Charles_Murray_(political_scientist)|Charles Murray] , while praising [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's literary accomplishments , criticizes [Ayn_Rand|her] claim that [Ayn_Rand|her] only " philosophical debt " was to [Aristotle|Aristotle] , instead asserting that [Ayn_Rand|her] ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [John_Locke|John Locke] and [Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche] .
Although [Ayn_Rand|Rand] maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system , philosopher [Robert_Nozick|Robert] H. Bass has argued that [Ayn_Rand|her] central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to [Ayn_Rand|her] central political ideas .
In 1985 , [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn [Ayn_Rand|Rand] Institute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas and works .
In 1990 , philosopher [David_Kelley|David Kelley] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies , now known as The Atlas Society .
The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching [Ayn_Rand|Rand] 's ideas or works .
In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to [Ayn_Rand|Rand] .
Noted autistic [Temple_Grandin|Temple Grandin] described [Temple_Grandin|her] inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with normal neural development , as leaving [Temple_Grandin|her] feeling " like an anthropologist on Mars " .
[Simon_Baron-Cohen|Simon Baron-Cohen] 's empathizing – systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize — that is , they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain — but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents .
These theories are somewhat related to [Simon_Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen] 's earlier theory of mind approach , which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others .
In [Simon_Baron-Cohen|his] review , Kenworthy states that " the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial " , however , " it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism " .
The Table Talk of [Martin_Luther|Martin Luther] , compiled by [Martin_Luther|his] notetaker , Mathesius , contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic .
[Martin_Luther|Luther] reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that [Martin_Luther|he] be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report .
The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which [Martin_Luther|his] brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair 's marriage to gain Blair 's inheritance .
The Wild Boy of Aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student [Jean_Marc_Gaspard_Itard|Jean Itard] treated [Jean_Marc_Gaspard_Itard|him] with a behavioral program designed to help [Jean_Marc_Gaspard_Itard|him] form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation .
The New Latin word autismus ( English translation autism ) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist [Eugen_Bleuler|Eugen Bleuler] in 1910 as [Eugen_Bleuler|he] was defining symptoms of schizophrenia .
[Eugen_Bleuler|He] derived it from the Greek word autós ( αὐτός , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean morbid self-admiration , referring to " autistic withdrawal of the patient to [Eugen_Bleuler|his] fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance " .
The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when [Hans_Asperger|Hans Asperger] of the Vienna University Hospital adopted [Eugen_Bleuler|Bleuler] 's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology .
[Hans_Asperger|Asperger] was investigating an ASD now known as [Hans_Asperger|Asperger] syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 .
[Leo_Kanner|Leo Kanner] of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when [Leo_Kanner|he] introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities .
Almost all the characteristics described in [Leo_Kanner|Kanner] 's first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness " , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders .
It is not known whether [Leo_Kanner|Kanner] derived the term independently of [Hans_Asperger|Asperger] .
[Leo_Kanner|Kanner] 's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to " refrigerator mothers " .
[Allan_Dwan|Allan Dwan] ( 3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981 ) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director , producer and screenwriter .
Born Joseph Aloysius [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] , who was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] ( 1857-1917 ) and [Allan_Dwan|his] wife Mary Jane [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] ,
née Hunt , moved with [Allan_Dwan|his] family to the United States when [Allan_Dwan|he] was seven years old , on December 4 ,
1892 by ferry from Windsor to Detroit , according to [Allan_Dwan|his] naturalization petition of August 1939 .
[Allan_Dwan|His] elder brother , Leo Garnet [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] ( 1883-1964 ) , became a physician .
At the University of Notre Dame , [Allan_Dwan|Allan Dwan] studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago .
However , [Allan_Dwan|he] had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when Essanay Studios offered [Allan_Dwan|him] the opportunity to become a scriptwriter , [Allan_Dwan|he] took the job .
Soon , a number of movie companies worked there year-round and , in 1911 , [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] began working part-time in Hollywood .
While still in New York , in 1917 [Allan_Dwan|he] was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association .
[Allan_Dwan|Dwan] operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa , California from August 1911 to July 1912 .
On 12 August 2011 , a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa , California .
After making a series of westerns and comedies , [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] directed fellow Canadian-American [Mary_Pickford|Mary Pickford] in several very successful movies as well as [Mary_Pickford|her] husband , [Douglas_Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks] , notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood .
[Allan_Dwan|Dwan] directed [Gloria_Swanson|Gloria Swanson] in eight feature films , and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm .
This short , also featuring [Thomas_Meighan|Thomas Meighan] and Henri de la Falaise , was produced as a joke , for the 26 April 1925 " Lambs ' Gambol " for The Lambs , with the film showing [Gloria_Swanson|Swanson] crashing the all-male club .
Following the introduction of the talkies , [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] directed child-star [Shirley_Temple|Shirley Temple] in Heidi ( 1937 ) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm ( 1938 ) .
[Allan_Dwan|Dwan] helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors , [Victor_Fleming|Victor Fleming] , who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind , and [Marshall_Neilan|Marshall Neilan] , who became an actor , director , writer and producer .
Over a long career spanning almost 50 years , [Allan_Dwan|Dwan] directed 125 motion pictures , some of which were highly acclaimed , such as the 1949 box office hit , Sands of Iwo Jima .
[Allan_Dwan|He] directed [Allan_Dwan|his] last movie in 1961 .
[Allan_Dwan|He] died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six , and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery , Mission Hills , California .
[Allan_Dwan|Dwan] has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard .
[Allan_Dwan|He] Comes Up Smiling ( 1918 )
Angel in Exile ( 1948 ) ( with [Philip_Ford_(film_director)|Philip Ford] )
The word was coined by the French philosopher [Auguste_Comte|Auguste Comte] in French , as altruisme , for an antonym of egoism .
[Auguste_Comte|He] derived it from the Italian altrui , which in turn was derived from Latin alteri , meaning " other people " or " somebody else " .
The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , [Auguste_Comte|Auguste Comte] , and has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists .
[Marcel_Mauss|Marcel Mauss] 's book The Gift contains a passage : " Note on alms . "
In it , [Marcel_Mauss|he] writes :
It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [David_Sloan_Wilson|David Sloan Wilson] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level .
The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [George_R._Price|George R. Price] 's development of the [George_R._Price|Price] equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution .
Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [Peter_Kropotkin|Peter Kropotkin] in [Peter_Kropotkin|his] 1902 book Mutual Aid : A Factor of Evolution and [Peter_Singer|Peter Singer] in [Peter_Singer|his] book A Darwinian Left .
[Daniel_Batson|Daniel Batson] is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory .
[Daniel_Batson|He] identified four major motives for altruism : altruism to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person ( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism ) .
Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the [Daniel_Batson|person] 's distress .
From biblical to medieval Christian traditions , tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of " disinterested love " , as in the [Paul_the_Apostle|Pauline] phrase " love seeks not its own interests . "
In [Paul_the_Apostle|his] book Indoctrination and Self-deception , Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism , by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self , and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many .
[Thomas_Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas] interprets ' You should love your neighbour as yourself ' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others .
Considering that " the love with which a man loves [Thomas_Aquinas|himself] is the form and root of friendship " and quotes [Aristotle|Aristotle] that " the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves ,
" [Aristotle|he] concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good ,
However , [Aristotle|he] thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life — since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude : a more desirable thing than bodily well being .
In coining the word Altruism , as stated above , [Auguste_Comte|Comte] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism .
1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love [Auguste_Comte|his] fellowman , and that hatred of one 's fellowman is the same as hatred of God .
[Thomas_Jay_Oord|Thomas Jay Oord] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love .
[Thomas_Jay_Oord|Oord] defines altruism as acting for the other 's good , and [Thomas_Jay_Oord|he] agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one 's own good when the other 's demands undermine overall well-being .
German philosopher [Max_Scheler|Max Scheler] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak .
At its worst , [Max_Scheler|Scheler] says , " love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred , repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etc. , directed against the opposite phenomena : wealth , strength , power , largesse . "
Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [Yunus_Emre|Yunus Emre] explained this philosophy as " Yaratılanı severiz , Yaratandan ötürü " or We love the creature , because of The Creator .
The famous Rabbi [Abraham_Isaac_Kook|Abraham Isaac Kook] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity .
Rabbi [Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto] in particular focused on the ' purpose of creation ' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force .
Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [Yehuda_Ashlag|Yehuda Ashlag] , in [Yehuda_Ashlag|his] writings about the future generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework .
[Yehuda_Ashlag|Ashlag] proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation , and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism , love for one another .
[Yehuda_Ashlag|Ashlag] focused on society and its relation to divinity .
The fifth Nanak , [Guru_Arjan|Guru Arjun Dev] sacrificed [Guru_Arjan|his] life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity , the [Guru_Arjan|Guru] Granth .
The ninth [Guru_Arjan|Guru]
, [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru Tegh Bahadur] , sacrificed [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|his] head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity .
In the late seventeenth century , [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] Gobind Singh Ji ( the tenth [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|guru] in Sikhism ) , was in war with the Mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh , Bhai Kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy .
[Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|He] gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield .
Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|he] was helping their enemy .
Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] Gobind Singh Ji , and complained of [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|his] action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield .
asked the [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] .
The [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] responded , " Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds .
You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] . "
It was under the tutelage of the [Guru_Tegh_Bahadur|Guru] that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism .
Agricultural science began with [Gregor_Mendel|Gregor Mendel] 's genetic work , but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in 18th-century Germany .
