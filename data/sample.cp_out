american [1composer2] georgegershwingeorge gershwin written in 1928 inspired by the time georgegershwingershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s and is one of georgegershwinhis bestknown compositions georgegershwingershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the [1conductor2] walterdamroschwalter damrosch walterdamroschhe scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns walterdamroschhe brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december 13 1928 in carnegie hall with walterdamroschdamrosch conducting the new york philharmonic georgegershwingershwin completed the orchestration on november 18 less than four weeks before the work s premiere georgegershwingershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the [1critic2] and [1composer2] deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as georgegershwinhe strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere georgegershwingershwin was attracted by mauriceravelmaurice ravel s unusual chords after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether mauriceravelravel took students and how much mauriceravelhe charged mauriceravelravel looked at georgegershwingershwin s prior year earnings and sent a telegram to georgegershwingershwin jokingly saying georgegershwinhe mauriceravelravel should study with georgegershwingershwin but georgegershwinhe accepted georgegershwinhim as a student georgegershwingershwin went to paris in 1926 ready to study and to enjoy georgegershwinhis first trip to paris after georgegershwinhis initial student audition with mauriceravelravel turned into a sharing of musical theories mauriceravelravel said mauriceravelhe could nt teach mauriceravelhim but mauriceravelhe would send a letter referring mauriceravelhim to nadiaboulangernadia boulanger while the studies were cut short that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a thank you note to georgegershwingershwin s hosts robert and mabel shirmer georgegershwingershwin called it a rapsodic ballet written so freely and much more modern than georgegershwinhis prior works georgegershwingershwin strongly encouraged mauriceravelravel to come to the united states for a tour something mauriceravelravel had been reluctant to do to this end upon mauriceravelhis return to new york georgegershwingershwin joined the efforts of mauriceravelravel s friend robert schmitz a [1pianist2] mauriceravelravel had met during the war to urge mauriceravelravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting francoamerican musical relations and was able to offer mauriceravelravel a 12000 fee for the tour an enticement georgegershwingershwin knew would be important to mauriceravelravel georgegershwingershwin greeted mauriceravelravel in new york in february 1928 at the start of mauriceravelravel s us tour and joined mauriceravelravel again later in the tour in los angeles after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills mauriceravelravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in a friend s music salon performing among kindred spirits mauriceravelravel s tour reignited georgegershwingershwin s desire to return to paris which georgegershwinhe did in march 1928 mauriceravelravel s high praise of georgegershwingershwin in an introductory letter to nadiaboulangerboulanger caused georgegershwingershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after playing for her she told georgegershwinhim she could not teach georgegershwinhim nadiaboulangernadia boulanger gave georgegershwingershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students do nt copy others be yourself in this case why try to be a second rate mauriceravelravel when you are already a first rate georgegershwingershwin this did not set georgegershwingershwin back as georgegershwinhis real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow georgegershwinhis rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezrapoundezra pound w b yeats ernesthemingwayernest hemingway and [1artist2] pablopicassopablo picasso georgegershwingershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in 1926 on georgegershwinhis first visit to paris as a gift to georgegershwinhis hosts robert and mabel schirmer georgegershwinhe described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than georgegershwinhis previous works georgegershwingershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as georgegershwinhe strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere georgegershwingershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claudedebussyclaude debussy and les six in the b section georgegershwingershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum after recapitulating the walking themes georgegershwingershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final â œ grandioso â although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it has recently come to light that georgegershwingershwin s intention was to have used the notes a4 b4 d5 and a4 it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles georgegershwinhe may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played georgegershwingershwin did not particularly like walterdamroschwalter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris walterdamroschhe stated that walterdamroschdamrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused walterdamroschhim to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than walterdamroschhis lukewarm concerto in f some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers cã sarfranckcã sar franck richardwagnerrichard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere georgegershwingershwin responded to the critics it s not a beethoven symphony you know it s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it the georgegershwingershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent georgegershwingershwin s true intent it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material georgegershwingershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during georgegershwingershwin s composition process [1conductor2] walterdamroschwalter walterdamroschdamrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance the first recording was made for rca victor in 1929 with nathanielshilkretnathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra georgegershwingershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however nathanielshilkretshilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the nathanielshilkretcomposer to leave the recording studio then a little later nathanielshilkretshilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so nathanielshilkrethe hastily asked georgegershwingershwin if georgegershwinhe might play the solo georgegershwingershwin said georgegershwinhe could and so georgegershwinhe briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that georgegershwingershwin had intended using the notes a flat b flat a higher c and a lower d the radio broadcast of the
